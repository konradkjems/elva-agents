# Demo Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Localhost URLs in Production
**Problem:** Demo links were showing `http://localhost:3000/demo/...` instead of production domain

**Solution:** Updated API endpoints to dynamically detect production domain from request headers

### 2. ✅ Mixed Content (HTTP/HTTPS) Error  
**Problem:** HTTP websites couldn't load in iframes on HTTPS demo page, causing:
- Browser blocking the iframe
- 10-second wait for timeout
- Mixed content security errors

**Solution:** Enhanced demo page with smart handling:
- Auto-detects HTTP/HTTPS mismatch
- Attempts to upgrade HTTP to HTTPS automatically
- Falls back to screenshot immediately if upgrade fails
- Shows clear messaging to users about why iframe can't load

## What Happens Now

### For HTTP Websites (like http://www.cotonshoppen.dk/)

1. **Page loads** → Detects HTTP URL on HTTPS page
2. **Auto-upgrade attempt** → Tries `https://www.cotonshoppen.dk/`
3. **If upgrade fails** → Shows screenshot immediately (no 10s wait)
4. **If no screenshot** → Shows message with "Open in New Tab" button
5. **Widget still works** → Chat widget is always functional

### For HTTPS Websites

Works perfectly with no issues - iframe loads normally

### For Existing Demos

You have a script to fix localhost URLs:
```javascript
// Run in browser console on your production site
fetch('/api/admin/update-demo-urls', { 
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log('✅ Updated:', data))
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy these changes** to production
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix demo URLs and mixed content handling"
   git push
   ```

2. **Update Vercel environment variables** (recommended):
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://elva-agents.vercel.app`
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://elva-agents.vercel.app`

3. **Fix existing demos** by running the update script (optional)

4. **Test a demo** - It should now:
   - Use production URL
   - Handle HTTP sites gracefully
   - Show screenshot for HTTP-only sites
   - Display widget correctly

## User Experience

### Before
- ❌ Localhost URLs in production
- ❌ 10-second timeout for HTTP sites
- ❌ Confusing error messages
- ❌ No fallback display

### After

- ✅ Clear messaging about HTTP/HTTPS
- ✅ Always functional widget
- ✅ "Open in New Tab" option
