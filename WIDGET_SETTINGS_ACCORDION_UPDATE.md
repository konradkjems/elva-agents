# Widget Settings Accordion Update

## Summary
Successfully transformed the widget settings interface from a horizontal tab-based layout to a modern, stacked accordion menu.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Structure
**File:** `components/admin/WidgetEditor/SettingsPanel.js`

- **Removed:** Headless UI `Tab` component imports
- **Added:** shadcn/ui `Accordion` component imports
- **Removed:** `activeTab` state variable (no longer needed)
- **Removed:** `tabs` array configuration

### 2. UI Transformation
Converted all 7 tab sections to accordion items:

1. **Appearance** (blue icon) - Opens by default
2. **Messages** (green icon)
3. **Branding** (purple icon)
4. **Satisfaction Rating** (yellow icon)
5. **Support Request** (red icon)
6. **Advanced Settings** (orange icon)
7. **Embed Code** (indigo icon)

### 3. New Component Created
**File:** `components/ui/accordion.jsx`

Created a new shadcn/ui accordion component using:
- `@radix-ui/react-accordion` for functionality
- Custom styling with Tailwind CSS
- Smooth animations via `tailwindcss-animate`
- Dark mode support

### 4. Styling Features
- Each accordion item has a rounded border card layout
- Icon-based visual identification for each section
- Color-coded icons matching the original design
- Smooth expand/collapse animations
- Hover states on accordion triggers
- Full dark mode compatibility
- Responsive stacking (works on all screen sizes)

### 5. Dependencies Added
- Installed `@radix-ui/react-accordion` package

## Benefits

1. **Better UX on Mobile:** Vertical stacking works better on smaller screens
2. **More Space Efficient:** Users can expand only the sections they need
3. **Modern Design:** Accordion pattern is familiar and intuitive
4. **Preserved Functionality:** All existing features, validation, and form fields work exactly as before
5. **Consistent Design System:** Uses shadcn/ui components like the rest of the admin interface

## Preserved Features
✅ All validation logic intact
✅ All field update handlers working
✅ ImageZoomModal integration preserved
✅ All form fields and behaviors unchanged
✅ Dark mode support throughout
✅ All existing icons and color coding maintained

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test each accordion section opens and closes smoothly
2. Verify all form inputs work correctly
3. Confirm validation messages still appear
4. Test dark mode switching
5. Check responsive behavior on mobile devices
6. Ensure the first section (Appearance) opens by default
