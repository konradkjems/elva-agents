# Documentation Cleanup Summary

## 📋 What Was Done

The root directory had **19 markdown files** that made it cluttered and hard to navigate. All documentation has been organized into a clean, hierarchical structure.

## 🗂️ New Structure

## 📌 Files Kept in Root

Only **1 markdown file** remains in root (as it should):
- ✅ **README.md** - Main project readme (updated with links to docs)

## 🗑️ Files Deleted

- ✅ `et --soft HEAD~1` - Incorrectly named file removed

## 📚 Already Organized

The `documents/` folder already had:
- AI_Chat_Widget_PRD.md
- QUICK-START-GUIDE.md
- WIDGET-MANAGEMENT-FRONTEND-PLAN.md

These were left in place as they're original project documentation.
