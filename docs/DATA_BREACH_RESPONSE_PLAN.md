## üìù Phase 3: Risk Assessment (12-36 hours)

### Determine Notification Requirements

#### Must notify Datatilsynet if:

- ‚úÖ Affects EU residents

#### Must notify affected users if:

- ‚úÖ HIGH RISK to rights and freedoms
- ‚úÖ Identity theft risk
- ‚úÖ Financial loss risk
- ‚úÖ Discrimination or reputational damage risk

### Risk Matrix

| Email addresses | MEDIUM | Maybe | YES |
| Chat messages | MEDIUM-HIGH | YES | YES |
| Payment info | CRITICAL | YES | YES |
| IP addresses | LOW | No | Maybe |

### Decision Tree

```
Was personal data breached?
‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Document as security incident, no GDPR notification
‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Poses risk to individuals?
    ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Minimal risk, consider notification
    ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Risk level?
        ‚îú‚îÄ Low/Medium ‚Üí Notify Datatilsynet within 72h
        ‚îî‚îÄ HIGH ‚Üí Notify Datatilsynet + Affected Users within 72h
