# 🎉 Phase 1 Complete: Foundation for Multi-Tenancy

## ✅ What Was Built

Phase 1 of the Subaccounts & Teams feature is now complete! This establishes the foundation for transforming Elva-Agents into a multi-tenant SaaS platform.

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Database Schema & Collections

**New Collections Created:**
- ✅ **organizations** - Client subaccounts with branding, limits, and settings
- ✅ **team_members** - Links users to organizations with roles and permissions
- ✅ **invitations** - Ready for team invitation system (Phase 3)

**Existing Collections Updated:**
- ✅ **users** - Added `platformRole` and `currentOrganizationId`
- ✅ **widgets** - Added `organizationId` for data isolation
- ✅ **demos** - Refactored to be platform-admin exclusive (no organizationId)

**Database Features:**
- Schema validation for data integrity
- Proper indexes for query performance
- Soft delete support for organizations
- Unique constraints on slugs and tokens

### 2. Migration Scripts

**Created 5 production-ready scripts:**

1. **`init-organizations-schema.js`**
   - Creates all new collections
   - Sets up validation rules
   - Adds database indexes
   - Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

2. **`migrate-to-organizations.js`**
   - Migrates existing users to have platformRole
   - Creates personal organization for each user
   - Migrates widgets to their owner's organization
   - Updates demos to new schema
   - Preserves all existing data

3. **`set-platform-admin.js`**
   - Promotes users to platform admin role
   - Simple CLI: `node scripts/set-platform-admin.js <email>`

4. **`verify-migration.js`**
   - Comprehensive verification of migration results
   - Checks data integrity
   - Reports issues and provides fixes
   - Must pass before proceeding

5. **`rollback-migration.js`**
   - Safety net to undo migration
   - Reverts all schema changes
   - Deletes new collections
   - Requires `--confirm` flag for safety

### 3. API Endpoints

**Organizations Management:**

- ✅ `POST /api/organizations`
  - Create new organization
  - Auto-generates unique slug
  - Sets up owner role
  - Returns organization with role info

- ✅ `GET /api/organizations`
  - Lists user's organizations
  - Includes role in each org
  - Sorted by current org first
  - Returns currentOrganizationId

- ✅ `GET /api/organizations/:id`
  - Get detailed org information
  - Includes team members list
  - Shows stats (widgets, members, etc.)
  - Lists pending invitations

- ✅ `PUT /api/organizations/:id`
  - Update organization settings
  - Owner/Admin/Platform Admin only
  - Updates branding, settings, domain

- ✅ `DELETE /api/organizations/:id`
  - Soft delete organization
  - Owner or Platform Admin only
  - Removes all team members
  - Cancels pending invitations

- ✅ `POST /api/organizations/:id/switch`
  - Switch user's organization context
  - Validates membership
  - Platform admins can access any org
  - Updates user's currentOrganizationId

**Security Features:**
- Authentication required on all endpoints
- Role-based permission checks
- Platform admin bypass for support
- Proper error handling

## 🏗️ Architecture Implemented

### Multi-Tenancy Model
```
Platform Admin (Elva Team)
    ├── Demos (Platform-exclusive)
    ├── Access to ALL Organizations
    └── Organizations (Client Subaccounts)
        ├── Owner (Client)
        ├── Team Members (roles)
        ├── Widgets (isolated)
        └── Conversations (isolated)
```

### Role Hierarchy
1. **Platform Admin** - Elva team, full access
2. **Organization Owner** - Client, full org access
3. **Organization Admin** - Manage team & widgets
4. **Organization Editor** - Create/edit widgets
5. **Organization Viewer** - Read-only access

### Data Isolation
- Each organization sees only their data
- Widgets filtered by `organizationId`
- Conversations filtered by `organizationId`
- Demos visible only to platform admins

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Backup Database**
   ```bash
   mongodump --uri="your-mongodb-uri" --out=./backup
   ```

2. **Initialize Schema**
   ```bash
   node scripts/init-organizations-schema.js
   ```

3. **Run Migration**
   ```bash
   node scripts/migrate-to-organizations.js
   ```

4. **Verify Migration**
   ```bash
   node scripts/verify-migration.js
   ```

5. **Set Platform Admin**
   ```bash
   node scripts/set-platform-admin.js admin@elva.com
   ```

6. **Test APIs**
   - Start your dev server
   - Test organization endpoints
   - Verify data isolation
