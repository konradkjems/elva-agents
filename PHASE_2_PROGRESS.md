2. New document in `elva-agents.team_members` (owner role)

## 🔄 What's Next: Remaining Phase 2 Tasks

### Task 4: Data Isolation Middleware ⏳
- Add middleware to automatically filter widgets by organization
- Update all widget API endpoints
- Ensure proper data isolation

### Task 5: Dashboard Updates ⏳
- Show organization-specific stats
- Display current organization info
- Update widget counts per organization

### Task 6: Widgets Page Filtering ⏳
- Filter widgets by current organization
- Update create widget to use current org
- Show organization context in widgets list

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Notes

### Session Refresh
- After switching orgs, full page refresh is needed
- This is intentional to ensure all data reloads with new org context
- Can be optimized in future with SWR/React Query

### Permissions
- Currently basic role checks (owner/admin/editor/viewer)
- Full RBAC from Phase 4 not yet implemented
- Sufficient for Phase 2 testing

### Delete Organization
- Soft delete (sets `deletedAt` field)
- Doesn't actually remove data
- Can be hard-deleted later or restored
