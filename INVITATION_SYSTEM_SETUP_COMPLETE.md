# ✅ Invitation System - Setup Complete!

## 🎉 Issues Fixed & Email Integration Added

### Issue Fixed: MongoDB Validation Error

**Problem:** Schema validation was rejecting invitations because:
- Expected roles: `admin`, `editor`, `viewer`  
- Our API uses: `owner`, `admin`, `member`, `viewer`

**Solution:** Updated MongoDB schema validation to match API expectations.

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `scripts/init-organizations-schema.js` - Updated schema definitions
- ✅ `scripts/update-invitation-schema.js` - Created migration script
- ✅ MongoDB collections updated via `collMod` command

---

### What Was Added:

1. **Email Service Utility** (`lib/email.js`)
   - `sendInvitationEmail()` - Beautiful HTML email template
   - `sendWelcomeEmail()` - Welcome new team members
   - Error handling (continues if email fails)

2. **Package Installed:**
   ```bash
   npm install resend
   ```

3. **Environment Variables Added:**

   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local` file:

# Resend Email Service
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here

# Email "From" address
# Test mode: Use @resend.dev
EMAIL_FROM=Elva Solutions <noreply@resend.dev>

# Production: Use your domain
# EMAIL_FROM=Elva Solutions <noreply@yourdomain.com>

# Your app URL (for invitation links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
# Production: NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### 3. Test the Invitation Flow
